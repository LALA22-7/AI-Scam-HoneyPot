## 📜 Overview
**"Ranjeet Uncle"** is an Autonomous AI Agent designed to waste scammers' time while extracting their financial details.

The agent adopts the persona of **Ranjeet Sehgal**, a 65-year-old retired Railway employee from Gorakhpur, UP. He speaks in a specific East Uttar Pradesh dialect (using "Hum" instead of "Mai"), acts technically illiterate, and constantly distracts scammers with stories about his pension and nephew to bait them into revealing UPI IDs and phone numbers.

## 🚀 Key Features
* **🎭 Active Persona:** Roleplays as a confused, talkative elderly man. He never breaks character.
* **🗣️ Dialect Engineering:** Uses "Hinglish" and regional grammar (East UP style) to sound authentic.
* **🕵️‍♂️ Stealth Intelligence Extraction:** A background "Spy" script uses **Regex** to automatically capture UPI IDs, phone numbers, and links from the scammer's messages in real-time.
* **🖥️ Dual Interface:**
    * **Web UI:** A WhatsApp-style chat interface for easy testing.
    * **REST API:** A full backend ready for integration with telecom networks.
* **🔒 Secure:** Uses Environment Variables for API key protection.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
* **Brain:** Google Gemini 2.5 Flash (Generative AI)
* **Frontend:** Streamlit (Python Web Framework)
* **Backend:** FastAPI (High-performance API)
* **Server:** Uvicorn
* **Logic:** Regular Expressions (Regex) & Pydantic
