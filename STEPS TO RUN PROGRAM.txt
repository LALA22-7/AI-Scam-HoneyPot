Open Terminal 1 (The Server)

Navigate to your folder:

PowerShell
D:
cd HACKATHON
Start the API server:

PowerShell
python -m uvicorn main:app --reload
Wait until you see: Uvicorn running on http://127.0.0.1:8000

Open Swagger UI

Go to your browser (Chrome/Edge).

Type: http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs

You should see the green POST /chat button.

Part 2: Host Publicly (For Friends)
This creates a tunnel so your friends can access your laptop's server from their phones.

Open Terminal 2 (The Tunnel)

Leave Terminal 1 running! Open a new terminal window.

Run ngrok:

PowerShell
ngrok http 8000
Copy the Magic Link
